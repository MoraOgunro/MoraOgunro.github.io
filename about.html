                    <p>I went to school for Computer Science and have a history with graphic design and web development. C#, Java, and Python are my current languages of choice. My current interests lie in software development, UI/UX design, and web/mobile development.</p>

                    <p>So uh, what do I do in my freetime? Gaming, graphic design, reading comics, and watching my favoite shows (shout out to Mr. Robot). I love DC comics, Android phones, movie soundtracks, and single-player narrative games. When it comes to hobbies, it's sometimes hard for me to stick to one thing. You see, I'm a huge rap fan. One day I decided to become a music producer and downloaded FL studio...I made one song and it was so bad that I deleted the program right then and there. Next, I decided I wanted to be a writer after getting hooked on Game of Thrones a couple years ago. And then, I decided I wanted to be a comic book artist after reading a particularly good Superman comic. Despite all of this, programming and graphic design are two things that I never felt that "this isn't for me feeling".
